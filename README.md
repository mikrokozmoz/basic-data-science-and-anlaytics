# Data Science Basics - Kaiyu MU

I created this repo to collect the useful resources while I am preparing myself to be a better data scientist. I hope this repo could help more people like me.

## Part I: Data Science Bloggs (Updated Jan 2022)
1. The Best Learning Resources for Data Scientists - by Abid Ali Awan (KDNuggets)
2. Data Quality: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly - by Nisha Arya (KDNuggets)
3. How I Went from Zero Coding Skills to Data Scientist in 6 Months - by Kate Marie Lewis (Medium)

## Part II: Certification & Certificates
### Entry-Level
1. **Data Science Council of America (DASCA):** [Associate Big Data Analyst](https://www.dasca.org/data-science-certifications/associate-big-data-analyst)
2. [Certified Analytics Professional (CAP)](https://www.certifiedanalytics.org/) & [Associate Certified Analytics Professional (aCAP)](https://www.certifiedanalytics.org/acap)
3. **DataCamp:** [Data Analyst Certification](https://app.datacamp.com/certification/data-analyst-professional)
4. **DataCamp:** [Data Scientist Certification](https://app.datacamp.com/certification/data-scientist-professional)
5. **Tableau:** [Data Analyst Certification](https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/certified-data-analyst)
6. **Tableau:** Data Scientist [Skills Badge](https://www.tableau.com/learn/learning-paths/data-scientist)
7. **Coursera:** IBM Machine Learning Professional [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning)
8. **Coursera:** Univeristy of Washington Machine Learning [Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)

The IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate is a new certificate I found on Coursera, I reviewed the syllabus and found it is more focusing on applying regressions and classification machine learning models. Thus, I think it should be a good reference for data scientists. If you don't need a certificate to build your careers, it is also useful to take other machine learning courses on Coursera. Here I recommend the [Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#about) course, which explain machine learning more thoroughly.

## Part III: Useful Repos
### Awesome Data Science

This [repository](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience) contains the link to several articles which articulate the definition and the function of data science. Besides, the repo also introduces different types of models and the common used ones.

### Data Science IPython Notebooks

This [forked repository](https://github.com/imlucasmu/data-science-ipython-notebooks) contains sample notebooks to the commonly used packages for data science modeling. I am trying to use these notebooks to practice train different types of machine learning models. I am referring to these notebook for the following Python packages and modelings.

**Packages**
1. Scikit-Learn
2. Keras
3. Tensorflow
4. XGBoost

**Models**
1. K-Means
2. MLP
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost
